# Design

The following documents the design of the Rust 2021 Trademark Survey starting
from high-level design goals down to specific questions we want survey data to
help us answer.

## Design Goals and Audience

The Rust Trademark Survey's goal is to help the Rust Foundation design a
trademark policy by gathering feedback from the community on how they would
want such a policy to be applied and enforced in practice.

Ultimately, the survey should help different audiences (discussed below) answer
the following questions:

* Can I use the official Rust name or logo in my offering?
* What use cases does the Rust trademark policy cover and not cover?
* Is the trademark policy self-explanatory so as not to continuously require explicit approval or counsel?

Parts of these questions will be interesting and useful to different audiences
of the survey results. The following are audiences we explicitly want to keep
in mind:

* The Rust Foundation
* Rust-based product Integrators
* Publicly consumed content creators
* Counsel making trademark usage determination

Ultimately each piece of information gained from the survey should be useful to
at least one of the audiences above. While it may be tempting to collect
interesting facts and trivia about Rust, the ultimate goal of the survey favors
information that is a *actionable*.
