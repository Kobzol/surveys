# The Rust 2021 Trademark Survey

The trademark survey is aimed at gathering data about how the community wishes
the trademark policy to function in practice to help guide the development of
the Rust trademark policy.

Discussion of the survey happens on [TODO: get a dedicated channel / stream for trademark survey discussions?](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/294169-t-community.2Frust-survey-2021).

## Basic principles

Trademarks protect users from confusion, meaning that when they engage with a
“Rust”- branded product or service they will be getting something with the
qualities they expect. Someone will choose the same fast food restaurant in
many different places because the brand signals to them that they will be
getting food with the qualities and characteristics that they expect.

Trademarks for open source software have a wrinkle not found in other types of
products. The copyright license allows the “product” – the software – to be
changed by others. The question becomes at what point users will be misled if
something is called “Rust” but has different qualities and characteristics than
what is available from the original source.

This source identifying/quality assurance function is not all that trademarks
are used for. Trademark law also covers confusion about whether the trademark
owner is endorsing or sponsoring the user. For example, when websites include
their customers’ logos on their websites, we understand that the customer’s
logo is being used to signal that the owner of the logo approves of or endorses
the product, and we take that information into account when considering the
product. A suggestion of endorsement that is inaccurate can also be a trademark
infringement.

Trademark law always allows others to use a trademark to truthfully describe
the product or service itself, such as “this program is written in the Rust
language.” The Rust trademark policy would not try to stop this type of lawful
use of the Rust trademark, or any lawful use of the Rust trademark.

With that background, a trademark policy is designed to do two things: (1)
define what, in Rust’s view, is permitted, lawful use of their trademark and
(2) optionally, grant some limited licenses allowing the use of the RUST
trademarks that, without the license, would be an infringing use.
