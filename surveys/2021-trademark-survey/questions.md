# Survey questions

Whether or not you use Rust <https://rust-lang.org> today, we want to hear from
you!

The Rust Foundation has created this survey to help us design a trademark
survey that best serves the users of the Rust programming language.

The purpose of this questionnaire is to get directional information. For that
reason, if you largely agree with an answer but not entirely, you should say
you agree. There will be further refinements as the trademark guidelines are
developed where we will be working out the nuances.

We are referring to the words RUST and CARGO and the logos, so assume the
question is about both the words and the logos. If the question is about only
the logos, it will be called “the Rust/Cargo logo.”

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about ? minutes to complete.

> TODOs:
>
> - Evaluate survey length
> - Can the community survey FAQ be generalized for all surveys such as this or
>   the trademark surveys?
> - Resolve and close open issues related to this survey on `rust-lang/surveys`
> - Are these questions being presented in the optimal order?

## Trademark Survey

### My personal belief about the Rust trademarks is:

Pick as many as you agree with:

- The Rust Foundation should be highly protectionist about them
- Trademarks are different from copyrights, so it’s ok to exert some control over how people use them
- The Rust Foundation should share trademarks as freely as it shares code

### If someone creates a Rust package from the original source code without changing the code in any way, can they still call the compiled package “Rust”?

- Yes
- No

> **justification**

> TODO

### How much of the Rust language can someone change and still call it “Rust”?

Pick as many as you agree with:

- Not at all
- Adding new functions/syntax but not removing anything or breaking anything
- Fixed bugs and other minor changes are ok
- They can change it any way they want

> **justification**

> TODO

### Under what circumstances can others put the Rust/Cargo logo on a website or social media site?

Pick as many as you agree with:

- Community members on their personal website or blog
- Community members can use as a profile picture on social media
- Commercial businesses, provided they have made a financial contribution to the Rust Foundation
- Commercial businesses, provided they have an open source project that uses Rust
- Anyone for any reason, as long as they link to the Rust homepage
- If they use it, they must say they aren’t endorsed by the Rust Foundation

> TODO

### Can meetups, conferences, or other groups use the Rust/Cargo logos?

- Yes, anyone can, commercial or non-commercial
- Yes, only if they are non-commercial
- Yes, but only if the event follows standards the Rust Foundation has defined
- No

### Can others create promotional goods, like T-shirts, USB drives, stickers, socks, and hats with the Rust/Cargo logo?

Pick as many as you agree with:

- No, the Rust Foundation should be responsible for ordering all of these products and handing them out
- Yes, for some types of items but not all kinds of items
- Yes, but they can only use designs that the Rust Foundation provides
- Yes, but only to give away, not for sale
- Yes, but only if some or all of the profits are donated to the Rust Foundation
- Yes, they can make whatever they like and keep the money

> **justification**

> TODO

### The Rust/Cargo logo should be under a copyright license that allows modification and sharing, like a CC license:

- No
- Yes, but only if it’s used for something that has nothing to do with software
- Yes, and it can be used even for software
