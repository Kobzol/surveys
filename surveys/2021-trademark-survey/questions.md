# Survey questions

Whether or not you use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) today, we want to hear from
you!

The Rust Foundation has created this survey to help guide the development of a
Rust trademark policy that best serves the users of the Rust programming
language. The purpose of this questionnaire is to get directional information.
For that reason, if you largely agree with an answer but not entirely, you
should say you agree. There will be further refinements as the trademark
guidelines are developed where we will be working out the nuances.

We are referring to the words RUST and CARGO and the logos, so assume the
question is about both the words and the logos. If the question is about only
the logos, it will be called “the Rust/Cargo logo.” Please note that the Rust
logo only refers to the "gear" logo, not Ferris the Crab.

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with the [Rust Foundation Privacy
Policy](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/privacy-policy/).

We estimate it will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

## Basic principles

Trademarks protect users from confusion, meaning that when they engage with a
“Rust”- branded product or service they will be getting something with the
qualities they expect. Someone will choose the same fast food restaurant in
many different places because the brand signals to them that they will be
getting food with the qualities and characteristics that they expect.

Trademarks for open source software have a wrinkle not found in other types of
products. The copyright license allows the “product” – the software – to be
changed by others. The question becomes at what point users will be misled if
something is called “Rust” but has different qualities and characteristics than
what is available from the original source.

This source identifying/quality assurance function is not all that trademarks
are used for. Trademark law also covers confusion about whether the trademark
owner is endorsing or sponsoring the user. For example, when customers’ logos
are included on websites, we understand that the customer’s logo is being used
to signal that the owner of that logo approves of or endorses the owner of the
website, and we take that information into account when considering the owner
of the website. A suggestion of endorsement that is inaccurate can also be a
trademark infringement.

Trademark law always allows others to use a trademark to truthfully describe
the product or service itself, such as “this program is written in the Rust
language.” The Rust trademark policy would not try to stop this type of lawful
use of the Rust trademark, or any lawful use of the Rust trademark.

With that background, a trademark policy is designed to do two things: (1)
define what, in Rust’s view, is permitted, lawful use of their trademark and
(2) optionally, grant some limited licenses allowing the use of the RUST
trademarks that, without the license, would be an infringing use.

### Can meetups, conferences, or other groups use the Rust/Cargo logos?

- Yes, anyone can, commercial or non-commercial

- No

### Can others create promotional goods, like T-shirts, USB drives, stickers, socks, and hats with the Rust/Cargo logo? (Pick as many as you agree with)

- No, the Rust Foundation should be responsible for reviewing and approving all of these products
- No, the Rust Foundation should be responsible for ordering all of these products and handing them out
- Yes, for some types of items but not all kinds of items
- Yes, but they can only use designs that the Rust Foundation provides
- Yes, but only to give away, not for sale
- Yes, but only if some or all of the profits are donated to the Rust Foundation
- Yes, they can make whatever they like and keep the money

### The Rust/Cargo logo should be under a copyright license that allows modification and sharing. (Note: This does not either require or prevent the use of a trademark license with other requirements.)

- No
- Yes, but only if it’s used for something that has nothing to do with software
- Yes, and the license must be an Open Source license, such as MIT, Apache or the like.
