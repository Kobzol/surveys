# Survey questions

Whether or not you use Rust <https://rust-lang.org> today, we want to hear from
you!

We've created this survey to help guide the development of a Rust trademark
policy that best serves the users of the Rust programming language.

The purpose of this questionnaire is to get directional information. For that
reason, if you largely agree with an answer but not entirely, you should say
you agree. There will be further refinements as the trademark guidelines are
developed where we will be working out the nuances.

We are referring to the words RUST and CARGO and the logos, so assume the
question is about both the words and the logos. If the question is about only
the logos, it will be called “the Rust/Cargo logo.”

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about ? minutes to complete.

> TODOs:

> - Evaluate survey length
> - Can the community survey FAQ be generalized for all surveys such as this or
>   the trademark surveys?
> - Resolve and close open issues related to this survey on `rust-lang/surveys`
> - Are these questions being presented in the optimal order?

## Basic principles

Trademarks protect users from confusion, meaning that when they engage with a
“Rust”- branded product or service they will be getting something with the
qualities they expect. Someone will choose the same fast food restaurant in
many different places because the brand signals to them that they will be
getting food with the qualities and characteristics that they expect.

Trademarks for open source software have a wrinkle not found in other types of
products. The copyright license allows the “product” – the software – to be
changed by others. The question becomes at what point users will be misled if
something is called “Rust” but has different qualities and characteristics than
what is available from the original source.

This source identifying/quality assurance function is not all that trademarks
are used for. Trademark law also covers confusion about whether the trademark
owner is endorsing or sponsoring the user. For example, when websites include
their customers’ logos on their websites, we understand that the customer’s
logo is being used to signal that the owner of the logo approves of or endorses
the product and possibly the content of the website, and we take that
information into account when considering the product and website. A suggestion
of endorsement that is inaccurate can also be a trademark infringement.

Trademark law always allows others to use a trademark to truthfully describe
the product or service itself, such as “this program is written in the Rust
language.” The Rust trademark policy would not try to stop this type of lawful
use of the Rust trademark, or any lawful use of the Rust trademark.

With that background, a trademark policy is designed to do two things: (1)
define what, in Rust’s view, is permitted, lawful use of their trademark and
(2) optionally, grant some limited licenses allowing the use of the RUST
trademarks that, without the license, would be an infringing use.

### Can meetups, conferences, or other groups use the Rust/Cargo logos?

- Yes, anyone can, commercial or non-commercial
- Yes, only if they are non-commercial
- Yes, but only if the event follows standards the Rust Foundation has defined
- No

### Can others create promotional goods, like T-shirts, USB drives, stickers, socks, and hats with the Rust/Cargo logo?

Pick as many as you agree with:

- No, the Rust Foundation should be responsible for ordering all of these products and handing them out
- Yes, for some types of items but not all kinds of items
- Yes, but they can only use designs that the Rust Foundation provides
- Yes, but only to give away, not for sale
- Yes, but only if some or all of the profits are donated to the Rust Foundation
- Yes, they can make whatever they like and keep the money

### The Rust/Cargo logo should be under a copyright license that allows modification and sharing, like a CC license:

(This does not either require or prevent the use of a trademark license with
other requirements.)

- No
- Yes, but only if it’s used for something that has nothing to do with software
- Yes, and the license must qualify as Open Source
