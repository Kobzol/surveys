# Survey questions

Whether or not you contribute to the Rust Project <https://github.com/rust-lang>
today, we want to hear from you!

The Rust Foundation has created this survey to help us identify the main
problems negatively affecting active, past, and potential contributors to the
Rust Project to help us plan programs that can most effectively support the
contributors and maintainers of the Rust Project.

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about ? minutes to complete.

> TODOs:
>
> - Evaluate survey length (the interviews took ~20-30 minutes)
> - Can the community survey FAQ be generalized for all surveys such as this or
>   the trademark surveys?
> - Define what it means to contribute to the Rust Projects.
>   - Use this definition as the multiple choice options for the "what kind of
>     work do you do within the project?" question
> - Questions to Add
>   - What part of the project did you contribute to?
> - Identify questions that don't need to be free-form
> - Cross survey cohort analysis would be useful, is it possible or ethical to
>   associate sets of answers across surveys?
> - Are these questions being presented in the optimal order?
> - Make sure none of the major cohort sections are leaving out relevant
>   questions that are asked of the other major cohorts.
> - Convert free form answers into partial multiple choice with some set of
>   known likely answers.
