# Survey questions

Whether or not you use Rust Programming Language <https://rust-lang.org> today,
we want to hear from you!

The Rust Foundation has created this survey to help us identify the main
problems negatively affecting contributors to the Rust Project to help us plan
programs that can most effectively support the contributors and maintainers of
the Rust Project.

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

> TODOs:
>
> - Ensure that the survey actually takes 10-15 minutes
> - Can the community survey FAQ be generalized for all surveys such as this or the trademark surveys?
> - Define what it means to contribute to the Rust Projects.
> - Questions to Add
>   - What part of the project did you contribute to?
> - Identify questions that don't need to be free-form
