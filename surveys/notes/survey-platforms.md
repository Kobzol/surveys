# Survey Platform

The survey platform we use is [SurveyHero](https://www.surveyhero.com) with a Business subscription.

## Functionality 

An ideal survey platform has the following functionality:
* One survey can consist of multiple translations
* The data is aggregated across translations
* Works in China 
* Low cost and pay-as-you-go

## Survey Platform Assessments

The following are the individual survey platform assessments for the platforms that we have considered.

Ultimately SurveyHero was chosen over the other options due to its combination of rich survey authoring, ability to handle multiple translations as one single survey, and reliability in China. We also closely considered SurveyMonkey, but SurveyHero was chosen due to slightly lower cost and it being more reliable in China.

### SurveyHero (surveyhero.com)

* One survey, multiple languages
* Single output format – reduced data wrangling
* Automatic translate powered by Google
* Ability to review translations and make edits
* Manual editing capabilities (Original text visible during translation)
* Native management of RTL text
* Requires Business ($55/mo. Individual; $39/user/mo. Team [2 minimum])/Enterprise ($89/mo. Individual; $69/user/mo. Team) level subscription
  * Both for the translations and for the logic required for the Rust survey
* As of 2021-09 works in China reliably (seemingly due to not being blocked and using Irish IP addresses which won't be mistaken for VPN IP addresses).

### SurveyMonkey (surveymonkey.com)

* One survey, multiple languages
* Single output format – reduced data wrangling
* All translation done outside of survey platform
  * Create survey in base language (if need RTL language, it must be the default for the survey)
  * Uses set of csv files that are exported (after initial survey creation) and then imported with translation – And is a beta feature.
* No automatic translate
* Requires Team Premier ($75/user/mo. w/ 3 user minimum & billed annually)
  * Both for translations & logic. 
  * 15,000 response max 
* As of 2021-09 works in China somewhat reliably (might be less reliable than SurveyHero due to using Japanese and Hong Kong IP addresses which have been used by VPNs in the past).

### Qualtrics

* One survey, multiple languages
* Single output format – reduced data wrangling
